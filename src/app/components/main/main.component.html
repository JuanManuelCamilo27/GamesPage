  <h1>Welcome to my playground</h1>
  <p>
    I wanted to put in practice what I have learned about Angular in different
    courses. I was trying to come up with a project that would keep my interest
    and I stumbled on a youtube video of someone making minesweeper. I figured
    what better way to learn than building some simple games.
